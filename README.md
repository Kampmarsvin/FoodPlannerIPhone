# FoodPlannerIPhone
Food planning application for iPhone. This is based on the c# version of the food planner I have created. It serves the same purpose, but is written in swift making it possible to compare the two languages.
The application is not complete, I have many ideas I want to implement, and eventually I will try to get it accepted into the app store. The application will always be free and open source
It is important to me that the app stays clean in the code, with functions that only handle on job, in order to build something which can easily be adjusted to everyones liking by using only the features necessary for the job.
